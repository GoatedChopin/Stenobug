# Stenobug
A nightmare-fuel C project for recording audio and sending it to a GCP API I built, Stenoflask. The audio is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model.


The closest I got was, arguably [the audio_http_plaintext.ino](https://github.com/GoatedChopin/Stenobug/blob/main/Failed/audio_http_plaintext.ino) attempt, which sends WAV files, albeit with no audio after the header.

Perhaps second closest was using the helper functions written by [pschatzmann](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools), which seem super helpful. By the time I found his library I had less than 1 day left to complete the project, despite looking for similar tools for +2 weeks.
